Philips Hue candle and ThunderStorm simulator

A Group change will reset the lights with a 1000 to 8000 random Hue (Red/Orange) every two seconds.
Each light randomly changes brightness to simulate a candle flickering effet.

Click on any of the 4 button to launch the storm with pseudo random time between stikes.
Minim analysis is used to trigger a britgh white flash on the lamp.
Three channels are available (left, right and middle) and are associated with lamps in the main code.
If the sound sample is in stereo it gives location info when strike is in Stereo.

Also included are 24 Thunder sounds captures mostly from youtube and processed with basic Audacity Noise Removal to remove rain sound.
It also gives a nice 'demoniac' background noise if you pay attention.

Code is NOT optimized, use ESC to quit and reset your lamps to a warm white.

Play some creepy classical/organ music, launch the sketch and enjoy...

Happy Hue-lloween
